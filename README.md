# QRx

QRx is a web-based and mobile-friendly application designed to help users verify the authenticity of their medicines using QR codes. By simply scanning the QR code on a medicine’s packaging, QRx checks the product details against a trusted database to confirm if it’s genuine or potentially counterfeit. The project aims to promote safe medicine consumption and protect consumers from fake or unsafe pharmaceutical products.
